== Credits ==
versions 1.0.0 - 1.0.2 were based on the [ShiftShort](https://github.com/short/shift-short-wp-admin-theme) plugin and used Icons by [Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/elegant-icon-font). However since the version 1.0.5 the plugin was completely rewritten and now uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/).
